StARQ: brainStem Automated Registration and Quantification
StARQ (brainStem Automated Registration and Quantification) is an open-source software for automated registration and quantification of the brainstem structures in MRI images. StARQ is written in Python and is based on the ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools) framework.

Features
Automated registration of the brainstem structures in MRI images
Calculation of quantitative measures such as volumes and cross-sectional areas
Visualization of the results in 3D and 2D views
Installation
To install StARQ, you will need to have Python and ANTs installed on your system. Once you have these dependencies installed, you can download the StARQ repository and run the installation script:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/starq.git
cd starq
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use StARQ, you will need to have an MRI image of the brainstem. Once you have an image, you can run StARQ by executing the starq.py script:

bash
Copy code
python starq.py input_image.nii.gz output_directory
The input_image.nii.gz argument should be the path to your MRI image, and output_directory should be the directory where you want the results to be saved. StARQ will generate a set of output files including the registered image, the segmentation mask, and the quantitative measures.
