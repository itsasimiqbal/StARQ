StARQ is an open-source software for automated segmentation and quantification of the brainstem structures in imaging data. StARQ is written in Python and built with PyTorch.

## ```Features```
```
- Automated segmentation of the brainstem structures in 2D images
- Calculation of quantitative measures such as cross-sectional areas for brainstem and signal quantification
- Interactive visualization of the results
```

Usage
To use StARQ, you will need to have a set of brain images with labelled regions. Once you have an image, you can run StARQ by executing the Inference script. Run the Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/itsasimiqbal/StARQ/blob/main/StARQ_2_0_2024.ipynb) script to test it on sample mouse brainstem imaging data. The input_directory should be changed with your data and output_directory should be the directory where you want the results to be saved.
